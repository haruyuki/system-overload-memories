            <p>System Overload contained lots of amazing builds made by many a wide variety of players, ranging from simple houses to large Pokemon Gyms. Unfortunately not all builds made by every player will be shown here, as many of them had not been saved or screenshotted. However, most of the publicly accessible places will be shown below.</p>

                <h1>Spawn</h1>
                <p>The iconic spawnpoint that have been seen many times by players as events were often helf on the central roof. The red corner building contains the Pokemon Centre as well as trading machines. The opposite blue building contained commonly used items for sale. When the world reset occured the spawn was moved into the air.</p>

                <h1>Littleroot</h1>
                <p>Littleroot was the first major town to pop up in the early days of System Overload. Initially started off by Tailstar, the small town attracted around 5-6 players. As it was the largest and most active area at the time the decision was made to place the Player Mall there close by. Any player whether from or not from the village will be able to setup their shop selling items they have gathered.</p>

                <h1>Littleroot 3 / Spawn</h1>
                <p>If you were wondering why Littleroot 2 was skipped, it did in fact exist, however there were no screenshots taken of the place before the second world reset occured. As for Littleroot 3, rather than a public town it became the new spawn after the reset. The town still had it's iconic Hollywood-style name written on a hill, and contained a small Pokemon Centre in initial landing area as well as an open-area shopping distict.

                <h1>Battle Arena</h1>
                <p>Previously if two players wanted to have a battle, if they lived close enough together they would travel to each other, but otherwise would both travel to spawn and battle on top of the spawn roof. However since the original spawn was replaced with Littleroot 3, there wasn't really a common place for players to gather and battle. To remedy this Mystery and I built this Battle Arena.</p>

                <h1>Electric Gym</h1>
                <p>The first large scale gym to be built by a non staff member at the time, Tailstar. The initial perimeter and the battle area was built in survival, however as the project continued the resource costs increased exponentially. It was at this time when Risha temporarily gave Tailstar creative mode to finish constructing the rest of the gym.</p>

                <p>The fire gym was the second large scale gym built by Tailstar. It was created to be similar if not the same as the Cinnabar Gym. Unlike the first gym most of this gym was created through WorldEdit, with only the badge and viewing platforms being manually placed.</p>

                <p>The third and last large scale gym created by Tailstar before other builders came in and built the rest of the gyms. Once again most of the gym was built with WorldEdit, however the hand was from a schematic found on PMC.</p>

                <h1>Pekon Village</h1>
                <p>After a long hiatus from the server after server payment issues, the server was reset again for the fourth time. Tailstar had ran out of ideas for what Littleroot 4 should be, and so left the task of creating the town to Peko, another companion of Tailstar's and the server's newsletter writer. He decided that he would name the place Pekon Village, and the theme to be in a somewhat oriental-style.</p>
